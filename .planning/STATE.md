# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-12)

**Core value:** Nodes in the tree reflect real-time state of external systems through a pluggable integration layer — turning any JSON roadmap into a live progress dashboard without locking users into a workflow.
**Current focus:** Phase 00 — app-scaffold

## Current Position

Phase: 2
Plan: 2 of 4 complete
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-15

Progress: [##________] 25%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 10min
- Total execution time: 0.17 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 00 | 3 | - | - |
| 02 | 1 | 10min | 10min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: -
- Trend: -

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 02 P02 | 11min | 2 tasks | 13 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Prerequisite: `bundleCEF: true` must be set in `electrobun.config.ts` from day one — not retroactively
- Prerequisite: Playwright not yet installed — add `@playwright/test` to devDependencies at scaffold
- Phase 2: `dataKey` pattern + Zustand store shape must be designed before any component work (react-d3-tree deep-clones on every data ref change — will break 30 fps gate if not addressed)
- Phase 4: Research gate required before any Event API implementation — covers port lifecycle, event contract, debounce design
- Phase 5: PNG export spike required before committing to an approach — html2canvas excluded (broken SVG support)
- All phases: Plugin system (smart adapters) is v1.1 — do not implement in any v1 phase
- Phase 2: Zod v4 z.record() requires explicit key+value types: z.record(z.string(), z.unknown()), not z.record(z.unknown())
- Phase 2: shared/types.ts re-exports use import-then-alias pattern for same-file RPC contract compatibility
- [Phase 02]: Used role=application on Canvas and role=button on RoadmapNodeCard for a11y compliance in react-d3-tree foreignObject rendering
- [Phase 02]: Used relative import path for @roadraven/core in bun/index.ts -- workspace alias not resolved by tsc bundler moduleResolution
